What is a Shell Script?
A shell script is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for a Unix-based shell (such as Bash or Zsh) to execute. Shell scripts can automate repetitive tasks, simplify complex processes, and enhance the functionality of a system by executing multiple commands at once.

Shell scripts can perform various tasks, such as:

File management (create, delete, move files)
System administration (user management, backups, etc.)
Automating software installations and updates
Running programs and scripts in the background
Text processing and manipulation
